I gained a proficiency with Adobe Creative Suite, especially Photoshop and Illustrator, and developed trainings for other staff members. I designed annoucements and advertisements to encourage patronage, as well as developed trainings for staff. I helped students with their computer questions, learning about computing at an institutional level along the way.

**User Experience Intern at LogiPref, Inc**  
IAP &#39;13

I worked with a team of two programmers to bring to life a prototype of LogiPref's innovative choosing algorithm. We developed a webapp to help consumers in Cambridge decide which meal would most appeal to them of all the restaurant options near MIT. My role was the overall design, user experience, and implementing the front end, although I became familiar with Django through the process as well.
