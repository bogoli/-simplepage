# *simplepage

<br/>

A one-page Jekyll theme. Built on <a href="https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged" target="_blank">Tim O'Brien's Single Paged</a> theme. Lightened, sweetened, and toned down, it still retains the bare bones of the original theme. Beautiful scrolling, and easy set up. 

<br/>

Images and videos are super simple to include. See the original documentation for instructions. Each section is formed by a Jekyll post. Ordering is based off filename.
