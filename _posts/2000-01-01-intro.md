# Lia Bogoev

<br/>

I'm a 22-year-old UX designer from northern Utah. I will be graduating from [MIT](http://web.mit.edu) in 2016 with a degree in [Art, Culture, and Technology](http://act.mit.edu), with a concentration in writing. 

<br/>

HTML & CSS are my favorite tools. Scalability and responsiveness are paramount. I like Sublime Text 2 and I use the [One True Brace Style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS).

<br/>

I like [weightlifting](http://stronglifts.com) and riding my fixed gear bike. I bake *really* good lemon bars. I write [poetry](http://poetry.liabogoev.com). My favorite subreddit is [/r/showerthoughts](http://www.reddit.com/r/showerthoughts). I love the snow, and I can't wait to get a dog. 

<br/>

I want to make the human experience better.
