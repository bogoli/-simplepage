<!-- ======================================THE ICON BENCH =====================================-->
<h2>The Icon Bench</h2>
This project was completed as part of **4.500 Design Computing**, in collaboration with my partner, <a href="http://ebsworth.tumblr.com">Tara Ebsworth</a>. The goal was to create a chair that was easily manufactured, out of common materials, and put together only using a rubber mallet. The intent of the design was to use as little wood as possible, and to still be comfortable and stylish. We achieved this by using thin slats of plywood that had some give, conforming to the body.

*Top left*: Cut sheet & Technical drawings, made in AutoCAD. We were able to fit the parts for 2 chairs onto one standard sheet of plywood. 
*Top right*: The parts and tools. All that was needed for assembly was a rubber mallet. Assembly took about 30 minutes. *Bottom left*: Detail of the friction fit joints. *Bottom right*: The finished product. 

For our final review, we were judged on both aesthetics and comfort, and this dainty little chair held our 6'4", 220lb instructor comfortably.

<!-- ============================================ The Quack House ===============================-->
<h2>The Quack House</h2>
The Quack House is a security guard shelter that stands next to a gated entrance. With a slanted window and a seductively angular design, it is both practical and beautiful. This project was completed as part of **4.500 Design Computing**.

We began with a cylindrical shape, and approached this issue of manufacturing it with straight materials. We decided to create the shape with straight panels, making a dodecagon. The roof, slanted window, and general form allows the guard house to still appear cylindrical.

The joints were 3D printed out of ABS, and the panels and base are plexiglass and masonite, spray painted for contrast. The roof was constructed out of bristol board.

<!-- ======================================== Studio Projects ===================================-->
<h2>4.112 - Architecture Studio</h2>
Every project that was completed through the semester of Studio 2 was based on the simple premise of a process completely removed from architecture: protein methylation. The dichotomous nature of this process provided the logic for the creation of a dynamic and interactive Processing drawing, which then became the starting point for two major projects. An expansion of the drawing into three dimensional space became a theoretical building space, made from plaster poured into a mold made of lasercut paperboard. The final piece measured one cubic foot.

<h3>Study Haus</h3>
A second major venture was the evolution of the Processing drawings into a usable space, rather than just a concept. From the undulating nature of the drawings, I theoreticized a building with spaces that could expand and contract based on occupation, from study carrels with thickened, accordion walls for sound insulation, to larger, airier rooms that encourage interaction and study groups.

From spaces of high density and activity in the drawings came rooms. Areas with lower density became smaller spaces within the building, lower rooflines providing coziness.
