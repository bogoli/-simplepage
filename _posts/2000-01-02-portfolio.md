<h1>The Icon Bench</h1>
This project was completed as part of **4.500 Design Computing**, in collaboration with my partner, <a href="http://ebsworth.tumblr.com">Tara Ebsworth</a>. The goal was to create a chair that was easily manufactured, out of common materials, and put together only using a rubber mallet. The intent of the design was to use as little wood as possible, and to still be comfortable and stylish. We achieved this by using thin slats of plywood that had some give, conforming to the body.

*Top left*: Cut sheet & Technical drawings, made in AutoCAD. We were able to fit the parts for 2 chairs onto one standard sheet of plywood. 
*Top right*: The parts and tools. All that was needed for assembly was a rubber mallet. Assembly took about 30 minutes. *Bottom left*: Detail of the friction fit joints. *Bottom right*: The finished product. 

For our final review, we were judged on both aesthetics and comfort, and this dainty little chair held our 6'4", 220lb instructor comfortably.
